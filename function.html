    <h1>Step 5: Functions</h1>

    <p>
       So far, we've learned how to draw a triangle and find the midpoint of a line, but what if
        we wanted to draw many triangles and find the midpoints of many lines? Currently, we would
        have to copy-paste our code repeatedly to do this, which would make our code lengthy, and
        could cause mistakes. What if we used <code>y1</code> where we meant to type <code>x1</code>?
        That would cause our code to not work as we expect it to, and copy-pasting code repeatedly
        is more likely to cause this behavior. Also, what if we wanted to change how we draw a triangle
        to draw red lines instead of black lines? We would have to change the code in multiple places,
        which would take a lot of time. It would be nice if we only had to change this in one place.
        <br><br>
        To solve this problems, we use something called functions. Think of functions like buying a basketball
        from a store. What if every time you wanted a new basketball you had to buy the rubber, bladder and
        other equipment to construct a basketball from its raw materials each time? This would be time-consuming
        and would cause a lot less people to play basketball. Instead, we have stores that have assembled
        the machinery to perform all the steps of constructing the basketball, and we just go to a store and buy
        it ready-made.
        <br><br>
        Just like basketball manufacturing, the goal of functions is to hide away the details of performing a task
        and allow us to reuse the code we've written to do that. For example, we could have functions like
        <code>drawTriangle</code> and <code>findMidpoint</code> that perform the tasks we need of drawing a triangle
        and finding a midpoint of a line. Functions have inputs and outputs. We can think of inputs as passing
        data to the function for it to do its job. In the case of <code>drawTriangle</code>, we need to pass in
        the 3 points we'd like to connect to draw the triangle. For <code>findMidpoint</code>, we need to pass in
        the 2 points that represent our line. The output of <code>findMidpoint</code> is the new point that is
        the midpoint of a line. We indicate that using the <code>return</code> statement.
        But what is the output of <code>drawTriangle</code>? Strictly speaking,
        it has no output, and you can see below that it has no <code>return</code> statement. This function
        uses something called a side effect, so while it does not return something to the code that calls this
        function, it changes the state of our system - which in our example means that it draws something to
        the screen.
        <br><br>
        Step through the example below and see how we are using functions to perform the same task repeatedly.
        How would you write a <code>drawRectangle</code> function that takes in an input of 4 points and draws
        a rectangle?
