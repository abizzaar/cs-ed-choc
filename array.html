    <h1>Step 3: Arrays</h1>

    <p>
       In our last exercise, the variables <code>x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3</code> were
        all floating around separately as distinct objects. It would be better if we could group <code>x1</code>
        and <code>y1</code> together because they are both coordinates of the same point.
        Furthermore, we'd like to group all the variables together because they are all
        components of the same triangle.
        <br><br>
        To solve this problem, we use something called an array that we create using the
        <code>[]</code> command. Think of an array like a bookshelf in a library - if we
        want to store all comic books together, we'd store them all on the same shelf. And we'd do the
        same for biology, cooking and sports books. In the same
        way, we will store each point in its own array with two values inside of it, the x coordinate and
        y coordinate.
        <br><br>
        But how will we group multiple points together inside a triangle? Think back to the bookshelf
        analogy - how would we group together all kids books (with categories like comic books,
        sports books, and drawing books)? We'd group all kids books in one rack of shelves, with each
        shelf as a different category. Similarly, to store a triangle, we can store it as an array of arrays,
        where the outer array has three elements, and each inner array is
        a point with two elements inside of it.
        <br><br>
        To access elements of an array, we use the command <code>array[i]</code> where <code>i</code>
        represents the <code>i-th</code> element of the array. Step through the code below
        and then see what changes when you change <code>array[0]</code> to <code>array[3]</code>.
