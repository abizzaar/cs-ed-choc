    <h1>Step 2: Triangles</h1>

    <p>
       Let us now see how we can use our knowledge of line-drawing to draw
        a triangle. Since a triangle is just three lines, if we have
        three points <code>(x1, y1)</code>, <code>(x2, y2)</code>
        and <code>(x3, y3)</code>, we could draw a line between
        each of the points to draw a triangle. Simple, right?
        <br><br>
        Below, you will notice the first line of code reads
        <code>let x1 = 100</code>. The command <code>let</code> creates something
        called a variable. You can think of a variable as a box
        that stores a value inside of it - whenever we open
        the box <code>x1</code>, we will get out the value 100.
        For now, we use these boxes just so we can have a consistent way of
        referring to the same value multiple times.

        <br><br>
        Step through the program below to see what's happening. This time,
        try scrolling on one of the numbers to change its value and
        see how it changes the image. Also trying changing the name
        <code>x1</code> everywhere it is used to something random, like <code>potato</code>.
        You will notice that the program runs the same.<code>x1</code> is just a name
        that we give to our variable, but we could have given any name that we wanted.
        As a thought experiment, how would you change
        this code to draw a rectangle instead of a triangle?
